## Introduction

Magic numbers are patterns in the first few bytes of a file or data stream which (hopefully, uniquely) identify the type of the  file or data stream. For example, a file which starts with "%!PS-Adobe-" is very likely a postscript file, whereas one which starts with the three bytes, 1F 8B 08, is very likely a gzip-compressed file.

This gem allows you to check a file or IO stream against a list of known magic numbers, and thereby determine its type.

## Install quickstart

Install (for the previous 1.1.x version):

    gem install file_signature

Bundler (for the current 1.2.x version):

    gem "file_signature", :git => 'http://github.com/distler/file_signature.git'

Require:

    require "file_signature"

## Details

This gem infers the content-type based on widespread programming conventions for data file formats. It is tested on MRI 1.8.7 and 1.9.3.  If you test it and find it working on other rubies please share your success.

Our principal guide to these magic numbers is:
http://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html
But we've also found useful input from [libmagic](https://github.com/glensc/file/tree/master/magic/Magdir) and other sources on the internet.

Typical uses of magic numbers:

  * quickly guess at a file's mime type
  * check if data matches the file's MIME type or extension
  * check if a web form file upload matches its HTTP content type

Compare:

  * MIME::Types ruby library 
  * Unix magic() command for testing files on disk
  * http://shared-mime.rubyforge.org/

## Usage

     require 'file_signature'

The gem adds two class methods to the File class, and two instance methods to the IO class.

     File.magic_number_type('myfile')

and

     f = File.open('myfile')
     f.magic_number_type

both return a symbol (or `nil` if the type is unrecognized) corresponding to the type of file found. Similarly,

     File.mime_type('myfile')

and

     f = File.open('myfile')
     f.mime_type

return a string, which is the corresponding MIME-type ('`application/octet-stream`' if unrecognized).

##TODO

 * This library currently contains some pathetic handful of bytestrings for type identification... see if we can import some /usr/share/file/magic or something to extend this so its actually useful for more people.
